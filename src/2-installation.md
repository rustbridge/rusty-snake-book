# Standard Installation of the Rust Compiler and Tools

## Linux and MacOS Users

For these platforms, it is recommended to use the [Official Rust Installation Process](https://rustup.rs/) via `rustup.rs`. When asked, the default settings (including the `stable` compiler) are suitable for this course.

This will process will install a number of tools required for this course, including `rustc`, `cargo`, and `rustup`.

## Windows Users

Windows Users may need to install additional tools. Please refer to the [following guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html#installing-rustup-on-windows) for installation instructions for Windows.
